# The Hidden Costs of "Affordable" Housing: Why Colombia's VIS Program Fails Families

## 🏠 The Promise vs. The Reality

Colombia's VIS/VIP subsidized housing program promises homeownership for working families. But our analysis reveals a troubling truth: **buying VIS housing is a financial trap that leaves families worse off than renting**.

## 📊 Key Findings

After analyzing 20 years of costs across multiple economic scenarios, we found:

- **In NO scenario does VIS ownership beat renting within 20 years**
- The best-case scenario still leaves owners **68.1 million COP poorer** than renters
- Families who sell early face immediate losses due to overpricing at subsidy ceilings

## 💸 The Hidden Costs They Don't Tell You

### 1. **Gray Delivery ("Obra Gris")**
- Properties delivered unfinished
- 30M COP in finishing costs
- Financed at 13% consumer rates

### 2. **Uncovered Down Payment**
- Government covers only 10% of the 20% required
- Remaining 10% financed at 15% APR
- Adds years of high-interest payments

### 3. **Location Penalty**
- Peripheral locations double commute time (20 hrs/week vs 10)
- Time costs compound with inflation
- Lost productivity and family time

### 4. **The Appreciation Myth**
- VIS units sold at inflated subsidy ceilings
- Constant new subsidized supply suppresses resale values
- Used units compete with new ones that qualify for subsidies

## 📈 The Numbers Don't Lie

| Scenario | CPI | Appreciation | 20-Year Result |
|----------|-----|--------------|----------------|
| Best Case | 1% | 2% | Owner loses 186M COP |
| Realistic | 3% | 1% | Owner loses 588M COP |
| Worst Case | 5% | 0% | Owner loses 755M COP |

## 🚨 The "Engaño" of Expected Returns

Many families believe real estate "always doubles" based on stories from emerging markets. But VIS is different:

- Prices start at artificially inflated subsidy ceilings
- Locations (Soacha, Bosa) lack scarcity or prestige
- Continuous new supply prevents appreciation
- 10-year lockup period traps families in bad investments

## 💡 Policy Implications

The current VIS model perpetuates inequality by:
1. Trapping working families in wealth-destroying "assets"
2. Subsidizing construction companies rather than families
3. Creating peripheral ghettos disconnected from opportunities

## 🎯 The Bottom Line

**Renting in central locations beats buying VIS in every scenario we tested**. Families are better off investing the difference in education, business opportunities, or liquid savings.
