üè† **The "Affordable" Housing Trap: Why Colombia's VIS Program Fails**

Just completed an analysis that every Colombian family considering VIS housing needs to see.

The shocking truth? In EVERY scenario we tested over 20 years, families who rent come out ahead of those who buy VIS housing. 

The "best case" scenario? Owners still lose 186 million COP compared to renters.

Why? The hidden costs nobody talks about:
‚ùå "Gray delivery" - 30M COP to finish your "finished" home
‚ùå Uncovered down payment - financed at 15% APR  
‚ùå Double commute time - 20 hrs/week in periphery vs 10 central
‚ùå The appreciation myth - VIS doesn't appreciate like normal real estate

The numbers are clear: VIS ownership is a wealth destroyer, not a wealth builder.

Families are better off renting centrally and investing the difference in education or business opportunities.

What's your experience with subsidized housing programs? Do they truly help families build wealth?
