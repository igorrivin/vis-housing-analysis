## Abstract for SSRN

**Title:** The Hidden Costs of Subsidized Housing in Bogotá: Rent vs. Buy, Liquidity, and the False Promise of VIS/VIP

**Abstract:**
We develop a comprehensive rent-versus-buy framework for Colombia's VIS/VIP (Vivienda de Interés Social/Prioritario) subsidized housing program, incorporating typically omitted frictions: gray-delivery finishing costs financed at consumer rates (30M COP at 13% APR), uncovered down payment portions financed at 15% APR, HOA fees growing with CPI, maintenance growing at CPI+2%, doubled commuting time costs for peripheral locations, transaction costs, and a 10-year lockup period with clawback provisions. 

Analyzing scenarios across different inflation rates (1-5%) and property appreciation rates (0-2%), we find no scenario in which VIS ownership outperforms renting within a 20-year horizon. The best-case scenario leaves owners 186.4 million COP worse off than renters. We identify three key mechanisms: (1) initial overpricing at subsidy ceilings creates immediate negative equity, (2) continuous new subsidized supply suppresses appreciation in peripheral locations, and (3) high financing costs for uncovered portions and finishing work compound the disadvantage.

Our findings suggest the current VIS model may perpetuate rather than alleviate wealth inequality, effectively subsidizing construction companies while trapping working families in wealth-destroying assets. Policy implications include redesigning subsidies as direct rental assistance or location-based vouchers rather than homeownership programs.
